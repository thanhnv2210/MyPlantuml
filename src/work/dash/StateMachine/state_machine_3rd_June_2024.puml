***LEGEND***
->TRANSACTION_ON_HOLD once released will have the states after TRANSACTION_SUBMITTED
->In case of AML call timeout, status will be PAYMENT_AML_FAIL with a error code
->[1] Error wil happen in different scenarios, hence assumption the record was successfully created on DB, the status will be updated.
